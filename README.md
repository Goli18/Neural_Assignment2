In first one, I have defined a function named string_alterenative and passed str parameter and then given first name 
and last name from console and attached both of them as full name and then sliced the full name string 
so that it returns every other char in the string.

In second one I Created the input .txt file with the provided two strings in read mode and them created a empty 
dictionary and then removed lines and spaces between the words and created a loop to count the words 
repeating in the file and stored them output.txt file in write mode as keys and values where the key 
means words repeating in the input file and values are occurrences. 

In third one, here I created a list of heights in inches L1 and then I created a list of cms(centimeters) then in for loop I 
in the L1 I multiplied each element with 2.45 so that I can convert the inches to centimeters in cm list a 
list of centimeters. And created a list comprehension L2
